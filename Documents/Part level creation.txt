Parts of the level are pre-created in which there are two important elements, 
the point at which this part begins and the point at which this part ends. 
The algorithm simply selects a random one from these parts and puts it in front 
of the character so that the beginning coincides with the end of the previous one, thus the level is built.

Parts are placed while the character moves at a certain distance from him
Parts that he has already run at a certain distance are removed
